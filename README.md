## ✨ Features

- **6 Attack Vectors**: TCP Flood, UDP Flood, HTTP GET/POST Flood, Slowloris, Multi-vector
- **Modern GUI**: Intuitive tkinter interface with real-time logging
- **Thread Control**: 50-2000 configurable threads
- **Duration Control**: 10-300 second attack windows
- **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid configurations
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time status and progress indicators
- **Thread-Safe**: Proper async logging and GUI updates

## 🎯 Use Cases (Authorized Only)

- **Red Team Engagements** - Simulate DDoS during authorized pentests
- **DoS Resilience Testing** - Validate WAF/IPS configurations
- **Load Testing** - Stress test web applications under controlled conditions
- **Security Training** - Educational demonstrations (lab environments only)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+$
- tkinter (for GUI programms)

## 🚀 Quick Start


# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ddos-pentest-gui.git
cd ddos-pentest-gui


# Run the GUI
python ddos_pentest_gui.py
📊 Usage
Enter Target: IP/hostname and port (80 default)
Configure: Threads (50-99999), Duration (1-300s)
Select Attack: Choose from 6 attack types
Execute: Click START ATTACK
Monitor: Real-time logs and status
Stop: Use STOP ATTACK button anytime
Attack Types


# Type	Protocol	Purpose
1	TCP Flood	SYN flood simulation
2	UDP Flood	UDP packet storm
3	HTTP GET	Layer 7 GET flood
4	HTTP POST	Layer 7 POST flood
5	Slowloris	Slow HTTP DoS
6	Multi-vector	Random attack combination
🛡️ Legal & Ethical Use
⚠️ AUTHORIZED USE ONLY ⚠️




## ✅ Allowed:
• Owned infrastructure testing
• Client-authorized pentests
• Red team engagements with RoE
• Lab/research environments
• Security training (isolated networks)

## ❌ NEVER:
• Production systems without permission
• Third-party infrastructure
• Competitors or rivals
• Any unauthorized network activity
Always obtain written authorization before testing.

🐛 Troubleshooting


Issue	Solution
"Connection refused"	Verify target/port accessible
"Too many threads"	Reduce thread count (start with 100)
GUI freezes	Normal during heavy attacks
No requests library	pip install requests
Firewall blocks	Test from authorized network
McAfee flagged this programm so disable any AV before running (it gets flagged because this programm is sending a suspicious ammount of requests)
